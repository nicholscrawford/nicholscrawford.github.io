##My personal website

I'm hoping this will function as a portfolio/playground for me to test ideas, display thoughts and code experiments, and project summaries and updates, among whatever else I feel. Currently not in the most presentable state, but in progress.

For the styling, I'd really like it to be flexible, so that I can experiment on different pages. For the home page, i'd like to go for a mix of teenage.engineering and a sort of magazine style https://fontsinuse.com/uses/25002/e-e-doc-smith-s-skylark-series-pyramid
