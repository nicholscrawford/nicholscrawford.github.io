            <p class="section-text">
                I'd like to build another robot arm. My past one had a lot of flaws, and I'm interested in iterating on it. But what is the reason to build one at all?

                Well I can think of a few.
            </p>

            <ul class="section-text" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom:10px">

                        Providing a low cost alternative to arms traditionally used in research. Research labs could more affordably increase their capacity, so students wouldn't have to worry about scheduling robot arm usage, or labs could build larger scale data collection efforts.

                        At-home experimentation. I'd really love to research making robot arms useful in at-home settings, but even if I'm successful, I couldn't afford one to actually play around with at home.
                        I think having an arm at home would be fun for displaying or using research at home, and motivating projects. I.e. if I want an arm at home to do laundry, I could actually attempt to program the arm to do it for me. Difficulties, or solutions could become research directions.

I may have good reason to make circuit boards, learn more about RTOS, and build good support infrastructure around the arm. 
                        (Like easy to use analytic IK, workspace descriptions, fast motion planning, etc.)

                        Guiding research towards lower cost hardware. This is more hypthetical, but there are differences between ~$100k and ~$1k (my target) arms. Less precision, limits on energy, or just the lack of brakes in the arm. 
                        Perhaps differences in arm construction may offer up different research priorites or strategies. Especially if our research is aimed at in-home robotics where low cost will be a priority.

                        Integrated hand(s). One strategy often employed in robotics design, is moving motors farther back along the kinematic chain. Hands are often seperate, leading to a large payload at the end of the arm.
                        Hopefully, I can integrate the hand's motors in to the robot, slightly further up the kinematic chain for better payload.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Broad Design Strokes</h2>
            
        
            <p class="section-text">
                There are a few big choices to be made. The structure of the arm, motor and controller type, gearboxes, bearing sytle, and manufactuing. First, the structure.
                This is settled by the goals. I'm interested in a 7-DoF, S-r-S style arm. Broadly, I feel mimicking the iiwa's structure is a solid choice. 
            </p>

            <p class="section-text">
                Motor type. Typical for hobby arms are servo motors. These are great because they are easy to control, have good holding torque, and are cheap.
                However, there's not really force control for the hobbyist servos. We want that for impedance control. That leaves DC and brushless motors. I'm not positive DC motors are a bad option.
                Though, I haven't seen anything that can match the speed/torque combo of brushless motors. For my last arm, I used very cheap brushless motors. They could get up to 1NM of torque, and go insanely fast. 
                I'd like to revisit to characterize them better, before selecting new motors/gearboxes. But I had a ~30:1 reduction, and it was still way too fast. The main disadvantage of the brushless motors is the cost of controllers,
                but recently I've found out you can get <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806254849413.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.3.39cb764dRtsazd&algo_pvid=3d23b467-dd03-4d23-848a-96d71d102b2d&algo_exp_id=3d23b467-dd03-4d23-848a-96d71d102b2d-1&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%21111.03%2154.40%21%21%21111.03%2154.40%21%402103399117056262306903950e562a%2112000037177025977%21sea%21US%210%21AB&curPageLogUid=RkyXH5GzP2ib&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A">
                    assembled ODrive boards from aliexpress for ~$60</a>. While I love Moteus controllers, and think it might be better to get the ODrives from their normal source, this price is hard to beat. Since each ODrive controls 2 motors, that's $30 per motor for control.

                So that's probably the motor/controller style I'll use for the arm.

                For gearboxes, last time I built plantary ones out of plastic. They were loud, broke fairly frequently, were hard to construct, and were large. I've seen a bunch of hobbyists online build their own cycloidal drives, and that could be an option.
                However, for ease of assembly, as well as the offered flexibillity, it might be best to go with metal pre-made gearboxes. In particular, on Aliexpress there are some <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805235065423.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.11.45533bf2QGnrX8&algo_pvid=ec2a5f17-664c-469f-a74e-afaacf13e0c5&algo_exp_id=ec2a5f17-664c-469f-a74e-afaacf13e0c5-5&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%2145.96%2123.44%21%21%21329.73%21168.16%21%402101f49317056266509696553e704a%2112000032997866457%21sea%21US%210%21AB&curPageLogUid=4aMwhCLmb1Ud&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A">cheap Nema24, high torque, high reduction gearboxes

                Bearings are another tricky item. For a lot of low cost robots, they use what I'll call normal bearings, and press fit or clamp mount them. I think this isn't a bad strategy, but it does make manufacturing a little trickier.
                I'm interested in using a "robot joint bearing" like <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2261800070997714.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.0.0.4dc7KtvCKtvCUJ&gps-id=pcDetailTopMoreOtherSeller&scm=1007.40050.354490.0&scm_id=1007.40050.354490.0&scm-url=1007.40050.354490.0&pvid=0056b264-da61-48e1-b079-f81d5d4754b4&_t=gps-id:pcDetailTopMoreOtherSeller,scm-url:1007.40050.354490.0,pvid:0056b264-da61-48e1-b079-f81d5d4754b4,tpp_buckets:668%232846%238114%231999&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%2179.00%2171.10%21%21%2179.00%2171.10%21%402103246c17056223054257229eb5ec%2120000000155695603%21rec%21US%21%21AB&utparam-url=scene%3ApcDetailTopMoreOtherSeller%7Cquery_from%3A">this</a>.
                It seems like it would be much easier to mount to, especially for joints 1, 3, 5, and 7. For the even numbered joints, I could use <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803983947717.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.1000014.19.2490XwUFXwUFdQ&gps-id=pcDetailBottomMoreOtherSeller&scm=1007.40050.354490.0&scm_id=1007.40050.354490.0&scm-url=1007.40050.354490.0&pvid=5e9e9fe8-aeac-480c-8841-cd85783efc8e&_t=gps-id:pcDetailBottomMoreOtherSeller,scm-url:1007.40050.354490.0,pvid:5e9e9fe8-aeac-480c-8841-cd85783efc8e,tpp_buckets:668%232846%238109%231935&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%2115.96%2111.97%21%21%2115.96%2111.97%21%402103246c17056226222355130eb5ec%2112000028264107610%21rec%21US%21%21AB&utparam-url=scene%3ApcDetailBottomMoreOtherSeller%7Cquery_from%3A"> flange bearing</a> on each side,
                though weight would be an important consideration.
            </p>

            <p class="section-text">
                For manufacturing choices, I'd like to avoid machining parts. Though I enjoy doing it, it would make the arm much more difficult/expensive to reproduce.
                For my last arm, I 3d printed a lot. The plastic isn't super strong, so it might not be a great choice for each part, but printing in certain orientations can be reasonably strong. Additionally, 3d printers are very availabe helping reproduction.
                Cut and bent sheet metal is a very strong option. Access is a bit tricky, but not awful. I think most universities have something like this, along with some maker spaces, and if all else fails, there are online servicies that can do it for you.
                Wood is also an option, though more flexible, and heavier per strength than metal.

            <p class="section-text">Most homemade robots have different goals. They're also largely 6-DoF. They have low payloads, are made with steppers, and don't do impedance control.</p>

                        The color choiced and vintage style make it quite a stand out. I'd love to incorperate making the robot pretty in to my own.
                        I'm also super impressed with it's operation and accuracy, possibly stemming from it's post-reduction position measurement.
                        That could be a good idea, though I hope it won't be needed due to low backlash in the system. 

                        I think its motion planning is cool, but isn't really what I'm going for in terms of research integration.

                        Not sure if the potential reduction in wiggle is worth the $70 for the robot bearing. I'm also not entirely uninterested in selling kits, or even assembled robots, though it'd have to be a high price. Their kits are about ~800 per bot, which isn't awful.
