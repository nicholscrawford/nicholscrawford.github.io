            <h2 class="section-title">FOC Control</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                Given that I've settled on using brushless motors, how should they be controlled?
                <br>
                <img src="./photos/bldc.gif" class="section-image" alt="Diagram showing how the bldc motors work." style="width: 50%; min-width: 200px">
                <br>

                Well we have to know the position of the motor somehow. Without a brush to control the magnets, we've got to turn our electromagnets on and off at the right time to get it to spin.
                If we only consider on/off/backwards, we have a limited number of possible magnetic field directions we can apply. Because of that, our torque will not be constant and efficiency/speed are limited.
                However, if we use pwm to control each stator, we can ensure the magnetic field is always optimally pulling the motor. That is sinusoidal control.

                <br>

                Field oriented control is the next step up. I'd like to delve into the algorithm a little more at a future date, but it does seem to perform the <a href="https://www.magnelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/A-comparison-study-of-the-commutation-methods-for-the-three-phase-permanent-magnet-brushless-dc-motor.pdf">best.</a>
                This is what I'm planning on using as the algorithm. But, I'm not planning on developing my own board for this, as there are existing options, and I want to actually finish the arm someday.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">FOC Control Options</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                So for options. The two most prominent are the ODrive, and Moteus. Skyentific used ODrive in his arm, though he has messed with Moteus before.
                I used Moteus controllers in my last arm.
            </p>

                <h3 class = "section-title"> Moteus</h3>
            <p class="section-text">

                I'm a huge Moteus fan. This controller(s) integrates the power switching, control algorithm, and encoder on to one board. It's great, and pretty easy to use.
                However, pricing is a dealbreaker here. I'd need 7 controllers, (more if I end up using brushless motors for the hand), and the current revision is $104, and the next-gen moteus-n1 is $159. 
                <br><br>
                <a href="https://mjbots.com/products/moteus-r4-11">https://mjbots.com/products/moteus-r4-11</a>

                <br><br>
                For my arm then this would be $728-$1113, not including shipping, or heat spreader plates.
            </p>

                <h3 class = "section-title"> ODrive</h3>
            <p class="section-text">

                ODrive doesn't improve much. Their latest gens are even more expensive, from $159-$229. For the full arm $1113-$1603.
                <br><br>
                <a href="https://odriverobotics.com/shop/odrive-s1">https://odriverobotics.com/shop/odrive-s1</a>

                <br><br>
                Their older ODrive, which they now don't reccomend for new designs, was for 2 motors and cost $259, or $130 per motor. Still too much.

                <h3 class = "section-title">Aliexpress ODrive</h3>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Here's where prices drop dramatically.  This would be ~$250 for the whole arm.

                
                ODrive3.6 Motor Double FOC BLDC High Power Optimized Motor Control Board 12-56V 60A Module Based on ODrive,  $54.40 <br>
                Shipping: $32.16 for 4 <br>

                $35.78 per moter, and we'd have an extra controller. Before going all out, it'd probably be best to verify quality, current, torque, etc.
                But this should give position, torque, and velocity control, and it's got a farily high current/voltage limit. Presumably uses same software as the ODrive, since it's a clone.

                <h3 class = "section-title">ODesc v4.2</h3>
                <p class="section-text">
                    These are hard to find documentation on. The best is <a href="https://sequremall.com/collections/odesc/products/odesc-v4-2-single-drive-high-current-high-precision-brushless-servo-motor-controller-based-on-odrive3-6-upgrade-software-configuration-compatible-with-odrivetool-foc-bldc?variant=42740269580476"> this product page here.</a>
                    "Based on ODrive3.6 Upgrade" might mean the ODrive S1, and it seems they want you to use the ODrive software for it.

                    They claim 70A continuous, 120A peak, and it comes with a heat spreader. 24V is $39, and 56V is $55, free shipping.
                    I'd probably do 24V for the last 3, and 56 for the first 4. That'd be $337 for the whole arm. <br> <br>

                    There are also some older versions of this, though they seem to be more expensive and less performant, so maybe not worth looking in to.

                <p class="section-text">

                    Another option I'm not sure is worth much investigation. There's not a lot of suppliers I can find, and it's quite expensive at $99 a pop which makes it basically a non starter. 
                    It's also not clear what the specs might be, in terms of current voltage, etc. <br>

                <h3 class = "section-title">Simple FOC - B-G431B-ESC1</h3>
                <p class="section-text">
                    This is an interesting option. They provide the algorithm, and then you do the rest. The cost is then a little trickier to calculate.
                    
                    This would require communication, computation, and a driver board. They show it working with Arduinos controlling power boards.<br> <br>
                    <a href="https://simplefoc.com/">Main website link</a>. <br> <br>

                    Under their driver boards, they show a bunch of different options they support. The best cost/performace ratio is probably this dev board from STMicroelectronics ($19). It also has an included STM32, so no need for aditional board. Program, tear the thing in half, and put in in the arm.
                    <a href = "https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/STMicroelectronics/B-G431B-ESC1/?qs=%2Fha2pyFaduj9HtQf9%2FgsBmvGqEl7EbEPOyTxg06xIidkuUIykXhpkA%3D%3D">Mouser link.</a> <br> <br>

                    Without a provided heat sink, and somewhat limited current/cooling, this would probably only be suitable for the last 3 joints/hand.
                    It may also take further dev time to actually get it working, since I'd have to program the STM32 and learn the libary a bit. It looks like they <a href="https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC/blob/master/examples/hardware_specific_examples/B_G431B_ESC1/B_G431B_ESC1.ino">typically use serial</a>, and I'd probably want to use CAN. I'd also have to look further into 
                    how to set a control law, though it does seem that force control is possible on the board. 

                    <br><br>

                    This would save probably like $60, which isn't nothing, but would make manufacturing moderately more difficult due to several different flashing/software pieces.

            <h2 class="section-title">Potential Configurations</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                There's a lot to rule out pretty quickly. Moteus, ODrive, and MIT Mini-Cheetah are out for cost reasons. We're left with Aliexpress ODrive, ODesc4.2, and the B-G431B-ESC1. 
                I'll list what I see as the configurations, their prices, and why they might be applicable. Later refinement will of course be important.
            </p>

            <h3 class = "section-title">Current and Cooling are not a Limiting Factor</h3>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Cost: $136.5 <br>
                    7x - B-G431B-ESC1 <br>
                    With limited power, this seems somewhat unlikely to me. However, it's certainly worth considering. 
                    If they can reliably hold 0.25 NM of torque, and we can use a 216:1 gear ratio to get ~50 NM, we'd be able to hold ~4kg at a meter. 
                    Not impossible as an option! It'd for sure be slower and less backdrivable with that ratio though. 
                </p>

                <h3 class = "section-title">Voltage Isn't That Important</h3>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Cost: $214.5 <br>
                    4x - 24V ODesc v4.2 <br>
                    3x - B-G431B-ESC1 <br>
                    This is tempting. It's a low total cost, with good cooling and current capacity for the tough joints. 
                    Would need to ensure that it can handle it.
                </p>

                    3x - B-G431B-ESC1 <br>
                    This is good for similar reasons, with still an overall low cost. It ups the voltage, which may help with speed and thus a higher gear ratio, but may need better cooling.
                </p>

                    3x - 24V ODesc v4.2 <br>
                    I jokingly titled this, but yeah maybe. 
                    A less beefy controller could for sure handle joint 7 if we're not planning on holding big long poles by one side.
                    This goes back to when I mentioned research direction. Arm strength isn't really considered much in current research, even though it's still applicable for the typical research arm.

                    2x - Aliexpress ODrive <br>
                    If for some reason voltage is our primary concern, the Aliexpress Odrive could fit in. 
                    It looks cheap, but with the shipping cost it's really only a marginal improvment over the low voltage ODesc.
                    However, if that voltage is useful, maybe it has a place.

                    MAXIMUM POWER! NO CONSIDERATION FOR COST! LET'S HOLD LONG POLES BY ONE END SO JOINT 7 CAN EXPERIENCE REAL TORQUE!
                    <br>
                    In all seriousness, it's nice to have uniformity for various reasons. Also it may seem like overkill, but we could get much more compliance with lower gear ratios at the distal end of the arm.
