                Given that I've settled on using brushless motors, how should they be controlled?
                <br>
                <img src="./photos/bldc.gif" class="section-image" alt="Diagram showing how the bldc motors work." style="width: 50%; min-width: 200px">
                <br>

                Well we have to know the position of the motor somehow. Without a brush to control the magnets, we've got to turn our electromagnets on and off at the right time to get it to spin.
                If we only consider on/off/backwards, we have a limited number of possible magnetic field directions we can apply. Because of that, our torque will not be constant and efficiency/speed are limited.
                However, if we use pwm to control each stator, we can ensure the magnetic field is always optimally pulling the motor. That is sinusoidal control.

                <br>

                Field oriented control is the next step up. I'd like to delve into the algorithm a little more at a future date, but it does seem to perform the <a href="https://www.magnelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/A-comparison-study-of-the-commutation-methods-for-the-three-phase-permanent-magnet-brushless-dc-motor.pdf">best.</a>
                This is what I'm planning on using as the algorithm. But, I'm not planning on developing my own board for this, as there are existing options, and I want to actually finish the arm someday.

            <h2 class="section-title">FOC Control Options</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                So for options. The two most prominent are the ODrive, and Moteus. Skyentific used ODrive in his arm, though he has messed with Moteus before.
                I used Moteus controllers in my last arm.
            </p>

                <h3 class = "section-title"> Moteus</h3>
            <p class="section-text">

                I'm a huge Moteus fan. This controller(s) integrates the power switching, control algorithm, and encoder on to one board. It's great, and pretty easy to use.
                However, pricing is a dealbreaker here. I'd need 7 controllers, (more if I end up using brushless motors for the hand), and the current revision is $104, and the next-gen moteus-n1 is $159. 
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                For my arm then this would be $728-$1113, not including shipping, or heat spreader plates.
            </p>

                <h3 class = "section-title"> ODrive</h3>
            <p class="section-text">

                ODrive doesn't improve much. Their latest gens are even more expensive, from $159-$229. For the full arm $1113-$1603.
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                Their older ODrive, which they now don't reccomend for new designs, was for 2 motors and cost $259, or $130 per motor. Still too much.
