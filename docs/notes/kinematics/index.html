            <p class="section-text">Kinematics in general refers to the motion of bodies in physics. In robotics we're interested in the kinematics of a robot, or the motion of the links and joints of a robot arm. 
                I'll writie about forward kinematics, where we're interested in how the joint angles of a robot arm affect the position and velocity of the end of the arm. 
                Also inverse kinematics, which is given an end position for the arm how the joint angles of the robot should be configured.

            <p class="section-text"> This is a colorless model of a KUKA iiwa robot arm.
                It's got 7 degrees of freedom, and I can control its joint angles in javascript.
                However, maybe I'd like to know where that endpoint is in space. What are its coordinates? 
                Well in 1955 Denavit and Hartenberg introduced what is now the standard: DH Parameters/Coordinates.

            <p class="section-text">
                First, separate your robot into links and joints. Joints are the part of the robot that change (rotate or extend) and links are the links between them. 
                We'll setup a coordinate system at each joint.
                For revolute joints, there is an axis of rotation which the joint revolves around. 
                For prismatic joints, there is an axis of extension/retraction which the joint moves along.
                We'll call this axis the joint axis, \(z_i\).

                
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-text">
                Our numbering scheme is going to be a little skewampus. A joint that connects link \(i-1\) to link \(i\), is joint \(i\).
                Thus the joint is at the proximal end of the link of the same number.
                That joint's axis, is \(z_{i-1}\). So, at the end of link \(i-1\) is joint \(i\), and then link \(i\). 
                Joint \(i\), and as a reuslt link \(i\), revolve around (or move along) axis \(z_{i-1}\).
            </p>
            
            <p class ="section-text">
                To set up the rest of our coordinate system, we observe that with two exceptions, any two lines in space have a normal between them (i.e. their normalized cross product or the normal to the plane they define).
                That normal, we'll call \(n_i\).
                \[
                n_i := \frac{z_{i-1} \times z_i}{\|z_{i-1} \times z_i\|}
                \]
                The origin \(O_i\) will be the intersection of \(n_i\) and \(z_i\), \(x_i\) will be our x axis, and will be along \(n_i\) pointing from \(z_{i-1}\) to \(z_{i}\).
                Finally, \(y_i = z_i \times x_i\).

                Now, we can measure the DH parameters. Taken from notes from John Hollerbach's intro to robotics <a href="https://my.eng.utah.edu/~cs5310/files/chapter4.pdf">class notes (password protected)</a>:

                We can use those parameters to get the homogeneous transformation matrix \(^{i-1}T_i\) from frame \(i\) to frame \(i-1\):

                \[ 
                    ^{i-1}T_i = 
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    \text{cos}(\theta_i) & -\text{sin}(\theta_i) \text{cos}(\alpha_i) & \text{sin}(\theta_i) \text{sin}(\alpha_i) & a_i \text{cos}(\theta_i) \\
                    \text{sin}(\theta_i) & \text{cos}(\theta_i) \text{cos}(\alpha_i) & -\text{cos}(\theta_i) \text{sin}(\alpha_i) & a_i \text{sin}(\theta_i) \\
                    0 & \text{sin}(\alpha_i) & \text{cos}(\alpha_i) & d_i \\
                    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
                    \end{bmatrix}
                \]

                We'll use this matrix to transform between each joint! Starting from the origin, we can now calculate the end effector position.
